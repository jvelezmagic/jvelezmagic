<p>{{% callout note %}}
<strong>Why is there this talk?</strong> 🤔</p>
<p>🐾 The last activity to carry out in my undergraduate program is to spend a year
staying in a laboratory that we like doing research. As you can imagine, I love
programming and learning new things all the time. That is why I decided to stay
with Dr. Julio-Saez’s group after he gave a virtual talk to my undergraduate
group. I could say that this talk represents the closing of my stay. However,
who knows, maybe, and it could be the beginning of more collaborations at
some point. Time will tell. For now, enjoy the slides and the talk! 😋✨
